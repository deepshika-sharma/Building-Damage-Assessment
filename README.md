Data from https://xview2.org/dataset

Assessing building damage after a disaster has struck is very important for disaster response and management in order to prevent significant losses to life as well as property. However, these natural disasters often impact large areas and access to these areas may not be possible.Using pre and post disaster satellite images of different buildings and locations can we predict the level of damage of a building?
